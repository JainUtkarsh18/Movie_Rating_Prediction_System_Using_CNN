## Introduction  

The Movie Rating Prediction System is built using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict the rating of a movie based solely on its poster. With the increasing importance of visual content in today's media consumption, predicting movie ratings solely from posters can be a valuable tool for various applications such as content recommendation and movie marketing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie posters along with their corresponding ratings. The dataset is sourced from [insert dataset source]. It contains a diverse collection of movie posters spanning various genres and rating categories.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas 

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Before training the model, ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed. Use the provided scripts or preprocess the data according to your requirements.

2. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. You can adjust hyperparameters and network architecture according to your needs.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualize the performance using appropriate plots.

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict ratings for new movie posters. Provide the path to the poster image as input to the model for prediction.
